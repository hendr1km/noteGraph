# noteGraph

noteGraph is a simple CLI tool written in Go that renders your Markdown notes into an interactive HTML graph.
It visualizes connections via Wikilinks and mirrors the hierarchical directory structure of your notes.

## ðŸš€ Usage

To use this tool, simply clone the repository and build the binary using Go:
```
go build -o graph
```
You can then either:
Move the graph binary into your `~/go/bin folder` and run it globally using the `graph` command, or 
Run it directly from your local notes directory using:
```
./graph
```
This command will generate a graph.html file in the current directory, containing a visual representation of your notes with Wikilink connections and folder-based categorization.
